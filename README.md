# SlopDaddy

## Overview

SlopDaddy is an open-source project aimed at combating AI slop. I have nfi if/how this will progress. All I know is enslopficiation is real and has no solution today. I think starting with X is a good place to try SlopDaddy's initial versions but it should generalize to any content.

## Goals

- Build a mechanism to dynamically adjust slop dataset
- Create a v0.1 slop classifier.

## How to Contribute

- If you're here then you already know how.
